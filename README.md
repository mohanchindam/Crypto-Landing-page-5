# Mohan Chindam

- I learned a few things like how to make a down arrow using transform and also came across how to position a background image.
- Polished my element background image sizing and positioning skills.
- It took nearly one and half hours to complete this project as it is similar to the previous one. 
- Improved in computing the sizes of elements and spaces between them.

- Below image shows the preview of the project:
